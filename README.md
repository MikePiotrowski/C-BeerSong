I converted my Java version to a C# version. It has since become something more.
I improved the code to run slower so that there is a 4-second delay between each bottle of beer.
It will also display the current Date and Time. The Date and time will be displayed in red.
The remaining font color is green to be easier on the eyes.
This will eventually be ported over to the MonoGame Framework, with the text in 3D and audio included.
Please be sure to look for a release in late 2023.

Below is an image of what the output looks like: 
It will count it down from 99 to 1. And then finally to no bottles of beer.
