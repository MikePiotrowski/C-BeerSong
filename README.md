I originally converted my Java version to a C# version. It has since become something more.
I improved the code to run slower so that there is a 4 second delay between each bottles of beer.
It will also display the current Date and Time. The Date and time will be displayed in red.
The rest of the font color is displayed in green to be easier on the eyes.
