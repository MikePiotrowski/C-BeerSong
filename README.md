I oconverted my Java version to a C# version. It has since become something more.
I improved the code to run slower so that there is a 4 second delay between each bottles of beer.
It will also display the current Date and Time. The Date and time will be displayed in red.
The rest of the font color is displayed in green to be easier on the eyes.
This will eventually be ported over to the MonoGame Framework, with the text in 3D and audio included.
Look for a release in early 2023.

Below is an image of what the output looks like:
